Orthomosaics do not need LIDAR, but can be enhanced by using it. Applications - Urban Planning: Create detailed maps of urban areas for planning and development. - Environmental Monitoring: Monitor changes in landscapes, vegetation, and other environmental factors. - Archaeological Surveys: Map and analyze archaeological sites with high precision. Steps 1. Capture LiDAR Data: Use an app like \"3D Scanner App\" or \"Polycam\" on your iPhone to capture LiDAR data of the area you want to map. 2. Capture Aerial Imagery: If possible, use a drone to capture high-resolution aerial images of the same area. This will provide the necessary imagery for the orthomosaic. 3. Export Data: Export the LiDAR data as a point cloud file (e.g., LAS or PLY) and the aerial images in a format compatible with your photogrammetry software (e.g., JPEG or TIFF). 4. Process LiDAR Data: Use software like CloudCompare or PDAL to process the LiDAR data. This can include filtering, noise reduction, and generating a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). 5. Photogrammetry Software: Use photogrammetry software like Agisoft Metashape, Pix4D, or OpenDroneMap to create the orthomosaic. These tools can integrate LiDAR data to improve the accuracy of the orthomosaic. 6. Combine Data: Import both the aerial images and the processed LiDAR data into the photogrammetry software. The software will use the LiDAR data to correct distortions and improve the accuracy of the orthomosaic.</p>"},{"location":"lab-ideas/lab-ideas-geospatial/#libraries","title":"Libraries","text":"<p>3D Scanning and Modeling    - Tools: Polycam, 3D Scanner App, OpenMVG, OpenMVS, Point Clouds    - Tools: PCL (Point Cloud Library), Open3D Digital Surface Models (DSM) Digital Terrain Models (DTM) Contour Maps    - Tools: QGIS, GDAL</p>"},{"location":"lab-ideas/rough/","title":"Rough","text":"<p>Infrastructure for the Rest of Us</p> <p>https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/781f1e70-d6e9-4f0d-8c7e-b069990a4f8c/en-US</p> <p>Building Your First Machine Learning Web App</p> <p>https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/b0b09da3-8c15-4c6a-aaf1-c265fe6e595d/en-US</p> <p>Skillbuilder questions</p> <p>https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/19790/play/134393/official-practice-question-set-aws-certified-ai-practitioner-aif-c01-english</p> <p>Skillbuilder learning material</p> <p>https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/19578/play/123655/fundamentals-of-machine-learning-and-artificial-intelligence;lp=2193</p> <p>Udemy questions</p> <p>https://derivco.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-aws-certified-ai-practitioner/learn/quiz/6463755#overview</p> <p>https://derivco.udemy.com/course/aws-ai-practitioner-certification-aif-c01-practice-exams/learn/quiz/6475903/test#overview</p>"},{"location":"lab-ideas/template/","title":"{Title}","text":""},{"location":"lab-ideas/template/#date-in-the-format-18-jan-2024","title":"{Date in the format: 18 Jan 2024}","text":"<ol> <li>Services covered</li> <li>Lab description</li> <li>Prerequisites</li> <li>Lab steps</li> <li>Lab files</li> <li>Troubleshooting</li> <li>Acknowledgements</li> </ol>"},{"location":"lab-ideas/template/#services-covered","title":"Services covered","text":""},{"location":"lab-ideas/template/#lab-description","title":"Lab description","text":""},{"location":"lab-ideas/template/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":""},{"location":"lab-ideas/template/#lab-steps","title":"Lab steps","text":""},{"location":"lab-ideas/template/#lab-files","title":"Lab files","text":""},{"location":"lab-ideas/template/#troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","text":""},{"location":"lab-ideas/template/#acknowledgements","title":"Acknowledgements","text":""},{"location":"labs/00-pages-setup/","title":"GitHub CI/CD: Markdown to Website","text":""},{"location":"labs/00-pages-setup/#18-sept-2024","title":"18 Sept 2024","text":"<ol> <li>Services covered</li> <li>Lab description</li> <li>Prerequisites</li> <li>Lab steps</li> <li>Lab files</li> <li>Troubleshooting</li> <li>Acknowledgements</li> </ol>"},{"location":"labs/00-pages-setup/#services-covered","title":"Services covered","text":"<ul> <li>GitHub Repos</li> <li>GitHub Actions</li> <li>GitHub Pages</li> </ul>"},{"location":"labs/00-pages-setup/#lab-description","title":"Lab description","text":"<p>Set up a Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment pipeline that publishes a website when markdown files are pushed to a repository.</p>"},{"location":"labs/00-pages-setup/#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<ul> <li>GitHub account</li> <li>VS Code</li> <li>Python</li> </ul>"},{"location":"labs/00-pages-setup/#lab-steps","title":"Lab steps","text":""},{"location":"labs/00-pages-setup/#set-up-your-project","title":"Set Up Your Project","text":""},{"location":"labs/00-pages-setup/#install-mkdocs","title":"Install MkDocs","text":"<p><code>pip install mkdocs</code></p>"},{"location":"labs/00-pages-setup/#create-a-new-mkdocs-project","title":"Create a New MkDocs Project:","text":"<pre><code>mkdocs new my-project\ncd my-project\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"labs/00-pages-setup/#configure-mkdocs","title":"Configure MkDocs","text":"<p>Edit the mkdocs.yml file to customize your site.
