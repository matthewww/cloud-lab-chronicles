## Set Up Your Project
### Install MkDocs:
pip install mkdocs

### Create a New MkDocs Project:
mkdocs new my-project
cd my-project

### Configure MkDocs
Edit the mkdocs.yml file to customize your site. For example:

site_name: My Documentation
theme:
  name: readthedocs
  
### Add Your Markdown Files
Place your .md files in the docs directory. For example, docs/index.md will be your homepage.

### Serve Locally
You can preview your site locally:
mkdocs serve
Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser to see your site.

## Push to GitHub
Initialize a Git repository and push your project to GitHub.

### Initialize a Git Repository:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

### Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub and create a new repository named your-username.github.io.
Add the Remote Repository:
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-username.github.io.git

## Set Up GitHub Actions
Create a .github/workflows/ci.yml file in your repository with the following content:
name: Deploy MkDocs

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.x'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material

    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      run: |
        mkdocs gh-deploy --force

With this setup, every time you push changes to the main branch, GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site to GitHub Pages. This way, you donâ€™t need to manually run mkdocs gh-deploy each time.
