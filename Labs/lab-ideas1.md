     1. Set up the ESP32-CAM to capture a continuous video stream.
     2. Use MQTT to transmit images or video data to AWS IoT Core or Azure IoT Hub.
     3. Set up an AWS IoT or Azure IoT rule to forward the video stream to a dashboard.
     4. Display the video feed in real time.
   - **Possible Extensions**:
     - Integrate with AWS Lambda/Azure Functions to process the video stream in real-time for object detection or face recognition.
