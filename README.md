# Cloud Lab Chronicles ðŸŒ¦
My goal here is to document the completion of 100 cloud labs, with a robotics and IOT flavour when it makes sense.

### Lab Index
- [00-pages-setup](https://github.com/matthewww/cloud-lab-chronicles/blob/main/docs/labs/00-pages-setup.md)
- [01-esp32-telemetry](https://github.com/matthewww/cloud-lab-chronicles/blob/main/docs/labs/01-esp32-telemetry.md) <--WIP

I want to to gain practical cloud experience to suppliment theory as I travel on the [AWS Architecture Certification](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs/AWS_certification_paths.pdf) Path. 
- âœ… [AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) 
- âŒ› [AWS Certified AI Practitioner Beta (AI1-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/)
- âŒ› [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)

I'm also interested in the Azure certifications as I work with .NET day to day. Also, Microsoft's investments in OpenAI has lead to tight integration to the Azure platform that is lacking in AWS.
- âœ… [Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/) 
- âœ… [Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/)
- ðŸ¤” Maybe: [Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals/)
- âŒ› [Azure AI Engineer Associate (AI-102)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/)

I figured that keeping track of my journey here might help keep me accountable to myself. Thanks [Leszek Ucinski](https://github.com/LesUski/100-Days-in-Cloud/tree/main) for the idea.
