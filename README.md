# Cloud Lab Chronicles
My goal is to complete 100 days of cloud labs, with a robotics/IOT flavour when it makes sense. Most likely the labs will be mainly in AWS.

The main objective is to gain practical experience to suppliment theory as I travel on the [AWS Architecture Certification Path](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs/AWS_certification_paths.pdf). 
- ✅[AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) 
- ⌛[AWS Certified AI Practitioner Beta (AI1-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/)
- ⌛[AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)

But am also interested Azure:
- ✅[Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/) 
- ⌛[Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/)
