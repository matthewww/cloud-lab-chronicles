# Cloud Lab Chronicles ðŸŒ¦
My goal here is to document my certification journey and the cloud labs I do to back up the learning. I'd like to give the labs a robotics and IOT flavour when it makes sense to do so.

I figured that keeping track of my journey here might help keep me accountable to myself. Thanks [Leszek Ucinski](https://github.com/LesUski/100-Days-in-Cloud/tree/main) for the idea.

## Certification Journey - Cloud

### Amazon AWS

I'm mainly concentrating on following the AWS ecosystem and the [AWS Architecture Certification](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs/AWS_certification_paths.pdf) path. 

| Status | Certification | Level |
|:---:|---|---|
| âœ… | [AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) | Fundamentals |
| âœ… | [AWS **AI** Practitioner Beta (AI1-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/) | Fundamentals |
| âœ… | [AWS Solutions **Architect** Associate (SAA-C03)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) | Associate |
| ðŸ¤” | [AWS **Machine Learning Engineer** (MLA-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate) | Associate |
| ðŸ¤” | [AWS Certified **Developer** (DVA-C02)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-developer-associate) | Associate |
| ðŸ¤” | [AWS Certified **Data Engineer** (DEA-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-engineer-associate/) | Associate |
| ðŸ¤” | [AWS Solutions **Architect** Professional (SAP-302)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-professional/) | Professional |

Neil Davis reccommends doing all three of the Associate level certifications before the Architect Professional. That's the Architect, Developer, and Sysops Admin Associate exams.

### Microsoft Azure

I am also interested in the [Azure Certifications](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE2PjDI), in part because I currently work with .NET day to day. Also, Microsoft's investment in OpenAI has lead to tight integration to the Azure platform, whereas AWS emphasizes the versatility of its foundation models through services like Amazon Bedrock, and I think this difference means it's worth looking at both.

| Status | Certification | Level |
|:---:|---|---|
| âœ… | [Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/) | Fundamentals |
| âœ… | [Azure **AI** Fundamentals (AI-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/) | Fundamentals |
| âŒ› | [Azure **AI Engineer** Associate (AI-102)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/) | Associate |
| ðŸ¤” | [Azure **Administrator** Associate (AZ-104)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/) | Associate (Prereq for Arch Expert) |
| ðŸ¤” | [Azure **Developer** Associate (AZ-204)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-developer/) | Associate |
| ðŸ¤” | [Azure Solutions **Architect** Expert (AZ-305)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-solutions-architect/) | Expert |

### Google Cloud

Down the line, studying for the Google Cloud Architect Professional could be revealing in understanding Google's approach in comparison to the other vendors.

| Certification | Level |
|---|---|
| [Cloud Digital Leader](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-digital-leader) | Fundamentals |
| [Cloud Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-engineer) | Associate | 
| [Cloud Architect](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-architect) | Professional | 
| [Cloud Developer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-developer) | Professional | 
| [Cloud ML Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/certification/machine-learning-engineer) | Professional |
