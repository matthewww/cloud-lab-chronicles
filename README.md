# Cloud Lab Chronicles ðŸŒ¦
My goal here is to document the completion of 100 cloud labs, with a robotics and IOT flavour when it makes sense.

I figured that keeping track of my journey here might help keep me accountable to myself. Thanks [Leszek Ucinski](https://github.com/LesUski/100-Days-in-Cloud/tree/main) for the idea.

## Certification Journey
My main lab objective is to gain practical cloud experience to suppliment theory as I travel on the [AWS Architecture Certification](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs/AWS_certification_paths.pdf) Path. 

### Amazon AWS
| Status | Certification | Level |
|:---:|---|---|
| âœ… | [AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) | Fundamentals |
| âœ… | [AWS AI Practitioner Beta (AI1-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/) | Fundamentals |
| âŒ› | [AWS Solutions Architect (SAA-C03)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) | Associate |
| ðŸ¤” | [AWS Machine Learning Engineer (MLA-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-machine-learning-engineer-associate) | Associate |
| ðŸ¤” | AWS Solutions Architect (SAP-302) | Professional |

I'm also interested in the [Azure Certifications](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE2PjDI) in part because I currently work with .NET. Microsoft's investment in OpenAI has lead to tight integration to the Azure platform, whereas AWS emphasizes the versatility of its foundation models through services like Amazon Bedrock.

### Microsoft Azure

|:---:|---|---|
| âœ… | [Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/) | Fundamentals |
