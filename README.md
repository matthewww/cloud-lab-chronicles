# Cloud Lab Chronicles ðŸŒ¦
My goal here is to document the completion of 100 cloud labs, with a robotics and IOT flavour when it makes sense.

### Lab Index

### Certification Journey
âœ… Passed | âŒ› Booked | ðŸ¤” Maybe

My main lab objective is to gain practical cloud experience to suppliment theory as I travel on the [AWS Architecture Certification](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs/AWS_certification_paths.pdf) Path. 
- âœ… [AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) 
- âŒ› [AWS Certified AI Practitioner Beta (AI1-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/)
- âŒ› [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
- ðŸ¤” AWS Certified Developer - Associate (DVA-C02)
- ðŸ¤” AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional (SAP-302)

I'm also interested in the [Azure Certifications](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE2PjDI) as I work with .NET day to day, and also Microsoft's investment in OpenAI has lead to tight integration to the Azure platform.
- âœ… [Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/) 
- âœ… [Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/)
- ðŸ¤” [Azure Data Fundamentals (DP-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals/)
- ðŸ¤” [Azure AI Engineer Associate (AI-102)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-engineer/)
- ðŸ¤” Developer Associate (AZ-204)
- ðŸ¤” Administrator Associate (AZ-104)
- ðŸ¤” Solutions Architect Expert (AZ-305)

I figured that keeping track of my journey here might help keep me accountable to myself. Thanks [Leszek Ucinski](https://github.com/LesUski/100-Days-in-Cloud/tree/main) for the idea.
