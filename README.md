# Cloud Lab Chronicles ðŸŒ¦
My goal here is to complete 100 days of cloud labs, with a robotics and IOT flavour when it makes sense. The labs will most likely be mainly in AWS. 

The main objective is to gain practical experience to suppliment theory as I travel on the [AWS Architecture Certification](https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs/AWS_certification_paths.pdf) Path. 
- âœ… [AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) 
- âŒ› [AWS Certified AI Practitioner Beta (AI1-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/)
- âŒ› [AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)

I'm also interested Azure as I work with .NET.
- âœ… [Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/) 
- âŒ› [Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/)

I figured that keeping track of my journey here might help keep me accountable to myself. Thanks [Leszek Ucinski](https://github.com/LesUski/100-Days-in-Cloud/tree/main) for the idea.
