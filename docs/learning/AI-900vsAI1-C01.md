# AI-900 and AI1-C01 Comparison
- [AWS Certified AI Practitioner Beta (AI1-C01)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-ai-practitioner/)
- [Azure AI Fundamentals (AI-900)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals/)

## Personal Reflection
Azure segmentation is simpler (Azure AI Services and Azure OpenAI vs AWS SageMaker, Bedrock, all the Foundation Models and all the older AWS AI services.)

The AI services also seemed more fragmented in AWS, it took me longer to differentiate all of them in my head (eg Rekognition, Textract, and Comprehend).

I felt there was deeper theory on the AWS exam, such as NLP evaluation metrics (eg. BLEU, ROUGE).

So overall, AWS difficulty was higher due to complexity and depth, though some of this may be due to it being a Beta.
