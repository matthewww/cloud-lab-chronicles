Conway’s law

The structure of any system designed by an organization is isomorphic to the structure of the organization. Consiencly design your system architecture and your organisation hand in hand and let them evolve together.

Dunbar’s number

150 - The cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships — relationships in which an individual knows who each person is and how each person relates to every other person.

Cynefin

Cynefin offers five decision-making contexts or “domains” — clear, complicated, complex, chaotic, and confusion — that help people to identify how they perceive situations and make sense of their own and other people’s behaviour.

Jobs to Be Done Theory

The theory that helps innovators understand how and why people make decisions.

Parkinson’s law

Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. Do shorter Sprints, Cycles, meetings, Timeboxes, etc.

Parkinson’s law of triviality

The time spent on any agenda item will be in inverse proportion to the sum of money involved.

Theory of Constraints

“A chain is no stronger than its weakest link.” Identify the system constraint. Exploit the system’s constraint. Subordinate everything else to the above decision. Elevate the system’s constraint. Rinse and repeat.

Gall’s Law

A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. Don't build or fix a complex system as a whole. Find the right granularity and introduce simple elements that work and keep the system working at all times.

Engelbart’s law

The intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential. Start small and slow to "get better at getting better.”

Little’s Law

Service time is the bottleneck that creates the queue.

Strangler fig pattern

Wrapping old code, with the intent of redirecting it to newer code—bonus points for Skunk Works cultural wrapping.

Brooks’s law

”Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.”

Dunning–Kruger effect

People who are unskilled in some area wrongly believe their ability is higher than average. They don't know what they don't know.

Occam’s razor

Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity. Keep your teams as simple and small as possible.

Pareto principle

For many phenomena, 80% of consequences stem from 20% of the causes.

Vierordt’s law

Retrospectively, “short” intervals of time tend to be overestimated, and “long” intervals of time tend to be underestimated.

Larmans Law

Organizations are implicitly optimized to avoid changing the status quo.
