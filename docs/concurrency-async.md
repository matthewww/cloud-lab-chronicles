### Threads
A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can be scheduled and executed independently.

### Thread Pools
A thread pool is a collection of pre-instantiated reusable threads that can be used to execute tasks, improving performance and resource management.

### Futures
A future represents the result of an asynchronous computation, allowing you to retrieve the result once the computation is complete.

### Async/Await
Async/await is a programming pattern that allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style, making it easier to read and maintain.

### Event Loop
An event loop is a programming construct that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program, often used in asynchronous programming.

### Coroutines
Coroutines are lightweight, cooperative threads that allow you to write asynchronous code without blocking the main thread.

### Channels
Channels are a means of communication between concurrent tasks, allowing them to send and receive messages.

### Mutex/Semaphore
A mutex (mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that ensures only one thread can access a resource at a time. A semaphore is a signaling mechanism that controls access to a shared resource by multiple threads.

### Task Management
Task management involves creating, scheduling, and managing the execution of tasks, often using futures or promises to handle asynchronous operations.

### Additional Information:
- **Java**: Java also supports **ForkJoinPool** for parallel processing.
- **Python**: Python's `multiprocessing` module allows for true parallelism by utilizing multiple CPU cores.
- **JavaScript**: JavaScript achieves parallelism using **Web Workers** and libraries like **Parallel.js**.
- **Go**: Go's `GOMAXPROCS` setting allows configuring the number of threads for parallel execution.
- **C++**: C++ provides **std::async** for asynchronous task management and **parallel algorithms** in the STL.
- **Rust**: Rust's concurrency model leverages its ownership system and type checking to prevent data races at compile time.
- **Kotlin**: Kotlin's coroutines are a powerful tool for asynchronous programming, offering lightweight concurrency.
- **Swift**: Swift's concurrency model includes **Grand Central Dispatch (GCD)** and **async/await** for structured concurrency.
- **C#**: C# supports parallel programming through the **Task Parallel Library (TPL)** and **Parallel LINQ (PLINQ)**.
